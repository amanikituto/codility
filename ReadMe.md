Codility Crash Course for Python
1. Introduction to Codility
Codility is a platform that assesses coding skills through timed coding tests. These tests are used by many companies during technical interviews. The tests cover a variety of topics, including algorithmic challenges, data structures, and problem-solving skills.

2. Basic Python Concepts
Before diving into Codility-specific topics, ensure you have a good understanding of basic Python concepts:

Data Types: int, float, string, list, tuple, set, dict
Control Structures: if-else, loops (for, while)
Functions: def, return, lambda functions
List Comprehensions
Error Handling: try-except
3. Common Topics in Codility
Codility assessments often cover the following topics:

Arrays
Strings
Stacks and Queues
Sorting
Binary Search
Prefix Sums
Counting Elements
Euclidean Algorithm
Sieve of Eratosthenes
Dynamic Programming
Greedy Algorithms
4. Study Guide
Arrays
Understand basic array operations: accessing, modifying, iterating.
Learn common problems: finding the maximum subarray, cyclic rotation, odd occurrences.
Example Problem: Find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.

python
Copy code
def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    max_current = max_global = arr[0]
    for num in arr[1:]:
        max_current = max(num, max_current + num)
        if max_current > max_global:
            max_global = max_current
    return max_global
Strings
Manipulate strings: slicing, concatenation, searching.
Solve problems like palindromes, anagram checks, and pattern matching.
Example Problem: Check if a string is a palindrome.

python
Copy code
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
Sorting
Implement and understand sorting algorithms: bubble sort, quicksort, mergesort.
Use Pythonâ€™s built-in sorted() function.
Example Problem: Sort an array of integers.

python
Copy code
def quicksort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)
Binary Search
Understand how binary search works and its applications.
Implement binary search for sorted arrays.
Example Problem: Find the index of a target value in a sorted array.

python
Copy code
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
Prefix Sums
Calculate prefix sums and use them to solve range query problems.
Example Problem: Compute the prefix sums of an array.

python
Copy code
def prefix_sums(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]
    return prefix
Dynamic Programming
Understand the basics of dynamic programming (DP).
Solve problems like the Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem, and longest increasing subsequence.
Example Problem: Compute the nth Fibonacci number using DP.

python
Copy code
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
    return dp[n]
5. Sample Questions and Answers
Question 1: Cyclic Rotation
Problem: Rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps.

python
Copy code
def cyclic_rotation(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return arr
    k = k % n
    return arr[-k:] + arr[:-k]

# Test
arr = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6]
k = 3
print(cyclic_rotation(arr, k))  # Output: [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]
Question 2: Odd Occurrences in Array
Problem: Find the element that appears an odd number of times in an array.

python
Copy code
def odd_occurrences(arr):
    result = 0
    for num in arr:
        result ^= num
    return result

# Test
arr = [9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 7, 9]
print(odd_occurrences(arr))  # Output: 7
Question 3: Tape Equilibrium
Problem: Find the minimal difference that can be achieved by splitting an array into two non-empty parts.

python
Copy code
def tape_equilibrium(arr):
    total_sum = sum(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    left_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        left_sum += arr[i]
        right_sum = total_sum - left_sum
        min_diff = min(min_diff, abs(left_sum - right_sum))
    return min_diff

# Test
arr = [3, 1, 2, 4, 3]
print(tape_equilibrium(arr))  # Output: 1
